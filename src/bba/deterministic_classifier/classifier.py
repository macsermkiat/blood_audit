"""Top-level deterministic classification entry point (issue #8).

The single public function :func:`classify` is the deterministic composition
over the Hb-tier rules + five bypass pathways. Precedence (top wins) is
specified in PRD §"Implementation Decisions §6":

1. Hb missing                       → ``INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE`` (no bypass)
2. Cohort ``MTP``                   → ``APPROPRIATE`` (``bypass_reason=mtp``)
3. Cohort ``UNKNOWN``               → ``NEEDS_REVIEW`` (no bypass; user constraint #9)
4. Bypass: peri-procedural ≤ 6 h    → ``APPROPRIATE`` (``bypass_reason=peri_procedural_6h``)
5. Bypass: pre-op crossmatch ≤ 72 h → ``APPROPRIATE`` (``bypass_reason=pre_op_crossmatch``)
6. Bypass: delta-Hb trigger fired   → ``APPROPRIATE`` (``bypass_reason=delta_hb``)
7. Hemodilution: Hb < threshold AND ≥ 2 L crystalloid in 4 h
                                    → ``NEEDS_REVIEW`` (``bypass_reason=hemodilution_flagged``)
8. Single-low-Hb-no-trend: Hb < threshold AND ``needs_review_single_low_hb``
                                    → ``NEEDS_REVIEW`` (``bypass_reason=none``;
                                       isolated Hb < 8 with no prior 24 h
                                       observation cannot be interpreted as
                                       confirmed anemia without a trend —
                                       PR #52 Codex P1 + hb_lookup contract)
9. Plain Hb-tier rule:
   - Hb < ``cohort_threshold``       → ``APPROPRIATE``
   - ``cohort_threshold`` ≤ Hb < 10  → ``NEEDS_REVIEW``
   - Hb ≥ 10                         → ``POTENTIALLY_INAPPROPRIATE``

Precedence notes:

* Hb missing precedes every other check — no signal can be interpreted
  without an Hb anchor, including a triggered delta-Hb flag (stale upstream
  state cannot override the structural "no current Hb" fact).
* MTP precedes peri-procedural / delta-Hb so the bypass_reason reflects the
  most clinically load-bearing fact when multiple signals fire.
* UNKNOWN precedes the bypass block because the system explicitly refuses
  to interpret signals without a confirmed cohort (Round 2 fix N1 +
  user constraint #9).
* Hemodilution is checked only inside the ``Hb < threshold`` branch — it is
  scoped to the auto-APPROPRIATE case it would otherwise produce, and never
  promotes a gray-zone or high-Hb result.
